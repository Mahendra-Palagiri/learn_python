14.	What is indentation and why is it important in Python?
15.	What are mutable vs immutable objects?

1. int,float,string,date,bool
2. by using variable name something like x = 1
3. input() is used when we want to capture user input and int() is used to convert the value to int (as by default the value type is string)
4. = for assignment and == for comparison
5. Comments will provide notes on what the action is for lookback and recall
6. A list is mutable. (i.e. elements can be added or added) where as tuple is immutable (elements cannot be modified after initilizing)
7. A dictinoary is a key value pair(s)
8. by using get() method of dictionary object as get can return none if the key doesnt exists instead of throwing exception
9. print()  --> prints the content of method and return  --> ussed in methods to retun back a tuple. (one or many values)
10. Yes , ex : retun max(num),min(numb)
11. __init__ acts as a constructor to the class 
12. classinstance.method()
13. global variables are available across the module where as lcoal variables are scope specific. (to a method or to a class etc)
14. indentation is the space at the start of line. python interpreter uses the correct indentation for understanding the blocks properly
15. A mutable object like lsit is something which can be modified where as immutable like tuple cannot be modified
