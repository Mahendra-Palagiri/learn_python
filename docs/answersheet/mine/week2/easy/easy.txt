1. Numpy array can be one dimensional or multip dimensional where as python list is a single dimensional array
2. numpy.array([<array elements>])
3. broadcasting in numpy is performing operation (addition/multiplication/substraction...) of numpy array elements from other value , variable or array
4. pd.iloc[0:0]
5. A series is a one dimensional array of elements and a dataframe is a dictionary array of elements
6. pd.dataframe(dict)
7. Matplotlib.bar()
8. To present the output of the plot being constructed
9. pip install seaborn , import seaborn as substraction
10. df[filter] --> filter example df[rank>1]
11. mean value of an array and standard deviation of an array
12. T.transpose(2d array)
13. .loc[] will give a value based on name wehre as iloc will give value based on index
14. histogram is used present data in mean curve
15. Dont know
