1. np.split will give an error if the array can be split into given number of sections where as np.array_split can split the array and arrange the remainign elemtns into last seciton. (asymetrcial)
2. df.groupy(by='name', ascending=False)[Score] it is typically used to group a dataframe
3. boolean mask is a filter and its based on a condition example score>80 etc and it can be applied like df[df['Score']>80]
4. if we have two dataframes then df1.merge(df2,on='name',join='left')
5. sum, mean, std 
6. df.strip to remove missing values?
7. loc is to get value by colname and iloc by index
8. by using hue?
9. plt.save
10. plt.plot() will show the output and sns.lineplot() will present data as a line plot
11. df[(score>80) & (subject=='math')]
12. dont recall (probably answer is vecotorization is possible indexing of data)
13. never tried
14. pivot should change rows to columns and viceversa. Never used melt
15. never worked on calculated columns
