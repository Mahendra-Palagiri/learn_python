### Week 1 — Day-by-Day Breakdown

## Week 1 — Day 1 ✅

- Focus: Introduction to Python syntax, variables, and basic I/O  
- Learned the basics of Python syntax and how to declare variables.  
- Practiced printing output and reading user input.  
- Understood data types: strings, integers, floats, and booleans.

✅ Outcome: Comfortable with writing simple Python scripts and handling basic input/output.

## Week 1 — Day 2 ✅

- Focus: Functions and control flow  
- Learned how to define and call functions.  
- Explored conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`).  
- Practiced loops: `for` and `while`.  
- Understood function parameters and return values.

✅ Outcome: Able to write reusable code blocks and control program flow effectively.

## Week 1 — Day 3 ✅

- Focus: Data structures - lists, tuples, dictionaries, and introduction to classes  
- Explored Python collections: lists (mutable), tuples (immutable), dictionaries (key-value pairs).  
- Learned when to use each data structure with examples.  
- Introduced basic class syntax and object-oriented concepts.  
- Created simple classes with attributes and methods.

✅ Outcome: Gained foundational understanding of Python data structures and basic object-oriented programming.



- **Type of lists**:
    > ### List
        Ordered: ✅   | Changeable : ✅  | Use Case : Sequences, item collections

    > ### Tuple
        Ordered: ✅   | Changeable : ❌  | Use Case : Fixed structure, return multiple
    
    > ### Dictionary
        Ordered: ❌ (3.6+ preserves)   | Changeable : ✅  | Use Case : ast lookup by key, named data

  ```python
    🔹 1. Tuple → For fixed pair of items (position matters, no labels)

    ✅ Use When:
        •	The two elements are tightly linked
        •	The meaning is implied by position
        •	You don’t plan to change them

    🧠 Example:
    coordinates = (40.7128, -74.0060)  # (latitude, longitude)
    name_pair = ("Alice", "Bob")       # two people


    🔹 2. List → For a sequence of items (even if just two), possibly growing

    ✅ Use When:
        •	You might add/remove more items later
        •	Order matters
        •	You don’t need labels

    🧠 Example:
    scores = [88, 91]

    🔹 3. Dictionary → When each element has a meaning (a label)

    ✅ Use When:
	•	You want to name each value
	•	The meaning is not obvious from order
	•	You want to access by key, not index

    🧠 Example:
    student = {"name": "Mahendra", "score": 95}
